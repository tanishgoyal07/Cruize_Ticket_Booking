Cruise tourism is essentially a form of enclave tourism and it encompasses 
all faces of the tourism industry- accommodation, transportation,
hospitality and attractions. Cruising has become the fastest growing
segment in the travel industry across the world and itâ€™s no surprise with
the wide variety of cruises on offer nowadays.

Cruise tourism refers to holidays which are entirely or partly based on a 
cruise ship. It enables tourists to experience a multi-centre holiday, whereby
they spend time at various destinations throughout their trip.
